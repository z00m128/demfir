DEMFIR build:

If you downloaded some "stable" release, you can skip to "Builded DEMFIR can be
installed..." - all files are created.

Needed SW
- Linux or Unix, maybe some unix-like enviroment (MinGW etc.)
- System progs cat, awk, grep, tr, make, bash compatible shell
- mkisofs (package cdrtools [http://www.fokus.gmd.de/research/cc/glone/employees/joerg.schilling/private/mkisofs.html])
- Macroassembler AS [http://john.ccac.rwth-aachen.de:8000/as/] (version 1.42 at
  least, DEMFIR _CANNOT_ be build with version 1.41rX
- Small utility bin2tap [http://zeroteam.sk/bin2tap.html]

Check config.a80 and select prefered features.
In demfir directory type 'make' and build should be done automatically.
All generated files can be deleted with "make clean".



Builded DEMFIR can be install in three ways:

1) Use ROM image (demfirXXXX.bin) and burn it with Zilog's permutor to EPROM or
   use some universal ROM installer and install it to FLASH ROM or MAPRAM of
   divIDE.

2) Use .tap file (demfirXXXX.tap), which contains Zilog's universal installer
   and load it from tape. It automatically installs DEMFIR.

3) Use ISO image (demfirXXXX.iso), burn it to RW or store it to CF, ZIPdrive or
   HDD. Insert this medium into DEMFIR, select .tap file (stored on ISO
   filesystem) and run it (LOAD ""). This way need working DEMFIR so can be used
   only for upgrade.

Press NMI. It detects IDE devices. Enjoy :)
