- FINDISO did't call GETREADY => one sector is skipped after medium change
  without reread
- Size of the medium is not refereshed or is broken in some cases (fixed ???)
- It allows speccyfy max. sector number to value taken from medium size, but
  image search is performed few sectors after => read error
- Running of .MFC snapshots is not OK, some problems with 2nd VRAM
- When pressed NMI without RESET after DEMFIR upgrade required initialization
  is not performed
