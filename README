DTP's EMulator FIles Runner
===========================

divIDE version


Features:
- All is done in NMI menu.
- Own detection of IDE devices.
- Works with iso9660 (CD-ROM image) directly from CD-ROM device or stored on ZIP
  drive, HDD or CompactFlash. Image is automatically detected only if is stored
  from beginning of the medium. If image is not stored from the beginning you
  have to use "search" function.
- Search for ISO image function. Start of the image can be detected by
  sequential medium read. It's not too fast so don't store your images too far
  from start of the medium.
- Ability to browse whole directory tree (integrated file browser).
- Everything is remembered (actual directory, cursor position, .TAP data etc.).
- Filetype autodetect. Screens by filelen, emulator files by extension.
- View of coloured (6912 B) or monochrome (6144 B) pictures with detection of
  border colour.
- Running SNA snapshots (48K and 128K) 
- Running Z80 snapshots (versions 1.x, 2.x a 3.x) with version and type info.
- Running MFC snapshots (48K and 128K)
- Tape emulator for TAP files (read only = save not supported). After you select
  TAP file in browser content is presented as "virtual" directory and you can
  set "load cursor". If your program reads data with ROM rutines and there is
  some active TAP file in DEMFIR (selected) all data is readed from IDE device.
  If TAP file is not active, data is readed from standard tape input (with
  default ROM routines).
- Modular architecture - some parts can be turned off at compile time and there
  will be space for some other modules.

NMI menu controls (keys are emphasised):
D = device  - device change (master/slave)
M = medium  - reread of medium and image detection
R = reset   - software reset (JP 0), with 'SYMBOL SHIFT' clears DEMFIR's RAM too
I = init    - new devices detection, with 'SYMBOL SHIFT' bypasses detected
              device size and set maximum size (128 GB for LBA a c. 8 GB for
              CHS). For CHS in addition get default geometry instead of actual
              (may help with old or nonstandard hdds).
              If build with WITH_WDC and hdd tells invalid actual geometry
              (some Western Digital hdds) DEMFIR try initialize CHS
              translation. After that instead of device name is text "CHS
              translation:" and three numbers (actual CHS). Then you HAVE TO
              detect devices AGAIN. If next detection will have the same
              result ("CHS translation:" etc.), your hdd is not able remember
              new geometry. Then use detection with 'SYMBOL SHIFT', it bypasses
              initialization of geometry too and hdd should be usable.
Q = quit    - exit from NMI menu, switch to selected VRAM (see 'V' key)
F = find    - finds ISO image on any place on medium (can't be performed on real
              CD-ROM). Searching for the image starts from actual position +
              size of selected image (if any) + offset of Primary Volume
              Descriptor (16 sectors of 2 KB). If you wanna start searching
              from actual position press key 'F' together with 'SYMBOL SHIFT'.
              Searching can be interrupted by key 'SPACE'.
S = sector  - with this function you can specify sector where ISO image is
              expected or where you want to start searching. Use keys 0-9 and
              A-F for hexadecimal number, 'SPACE' for move to next position,
              'SYMBOL SHIFT' for move to previous position. Input goes from
              right to left and digit position is significant. After 7th digit
              cursor goes to start (1st digit) - can't go back (with 'SYMBOL
              SHIFT'). 'ENTER' quits input mode and new sector number is used to
              read new ISO image (when you get 'No ISO image found' message, try
              searching).
E = eject   - ejects the medium (ATAPI only)
V = VRAM    - shows actual Video RAM (always 1st after NMI), next press of 'V'
              key swaps 1st and 2nd VRAM. If there is no keypress within two
              seconds after last keypress, displayed VRAM is set for Quit and
              DEMFIR returns to NMI menu. In 48K mode only shows 1st VRAM,
              switching doesn't work.
Enter       - starts file browser

File browser controls:
up          - move cursor to previous file
down        - move cursor to next file
left        - skip to begin of the page, if cursor is already on the beginning
              skip to previous page
right       - skip to end of the page, if cursor is already on the and, skip to
              next page
Enter       - action = view of the picture (waits for any key), snapshot run,
              walk through directories or TAP files, "load cursor" set (depends
              on circumstances)
Space       - file browser exit


When you working with TAP files, cursor goes green (everything is ok), red
(broken TAP file) or yellow (TAP file is ok, but contains too many files and
DEMFIR can't index it => you can't use these unindexed files).

When LOADing from TAP file and "load cursor" come to file end, TAP file is
automatically "rewinded" to start. Position of "load cursor" can be anytime
determined/changed by file browser.

First line in NMI menu shows (left to right)
- interrupt status (IM1/IM2, EI/DI)
- actual mode (48K/128K)
- active 128K page
- selected VRAM (can't be detected)

Second line shows list of supported formats
- Z80 = Z80 snaps, all versions, enabled by WITH_Z80 in config.a80
- SNA = SNA snaps, enabled by WITH_SNA in config.a80
- MFC = MFC snaps, enabled by WITH_MFC in config.a80
- SCR = picture viewer, enabled by WITH_SCR in config.a80

Third line shows other modules and settings
- CHS = support for HDD without LBA, enabled by WITH_CHS in config.a80
- WDC = automatic geometry pre-set during device detection, required for some
        Western Caviar disks, enabled by WITH_WDC in config.a80
- LoT = Long Timeout, extended timeout for devices, needed by some CDROMs and
        HDDs, for CFs can be turned off, enabled by TOUT_LONG in config.a80
- SSv = screen saver (blank screen after two minutes), enabled by WITH_SS in
        config.a80

Logo can be selected by LOGO_TNT (older) or LOGO_F6 (new and much better), if
no one is selected, instead of logo will be text line.
