DTP's EMulator FIles Runner
===========================

divIDE version


Features:
- All is done in NMI menu.
- Own detection of IDE devices.
- Works with iso9660 (CD-ROM image) directly from CD-ROM device or stored on ZIP
  drive, HDD or CompactFlash. Image is automatically detected only if is stored
  from beginning of the medium. If image is not stored from the beginning you
  have to use "search" function.
- Search for ISO image function. Start of the image can be detected by
  sequential medium read. It's not too fast so don't store your images too far
  from start of the medium.
- Ability to browse whole directory tree (integrated file browser).
- Everything is remembered (actual directory, cursor position, .TAP data etc.).
- Filetype autodetect. Screens by filelen, emulator files by extension.
- View of coloured (6912 B) or monochrome (6144 B) pictures with detection of
  border colour.
- Running SNA snapshots (48K version only) [if you have some 128K SNA send it to
  me and I'll add support for it].
- Running Z80 snapshots (versions 1.x, 2.x a 3.x) with version and type info.
- Running MFC snapshots (48K i 128K)
- Tape emulator for TAP files (read only = save not supported). After you select
  TAP file in browser content is presented as "virtual" directory and you can
  set "load cursor". If your program reads data with ROM rutines and there is
  some active TAP file in DEMFIR (selected) all data is readed from IDE device.
  If TAP file is not active, data is readed from standard tape input (with
  default ROM routines).

NMI menu controls (keys are emphasised):
D = device  - device change (master/slave)
M = medium  - reread of medium and image detection
R = reset   - software reset (JP 0)
I = init    - new device detect (cold start)
Q = quit    - exit from NMI menu
F = find    - finds ISO image on any place on medium (can't be performed on real
              CD-ROM). Searching for the image starts from actual position +
              size of selected image (if any) + offset of Primary Volume
              Descriptor (16 sectors of 2 KB). If you wanna start searching
              from actual position press key 'F' together with 'CAPS SHIFT'.
              Searching can be interrupted by key 'SPACE'.
S = sector  - with this function you can specify sector where ISO image is
              expected or where you want to start searching. Use keys 0-9 and
              A-F for hexadecimal number, 'SPACE' for move to next position,
              'SYMBOL SHIFT' for move to previous position. Input goes from
              right to left and digit position is significant. After 7th digit
              cursor goes to start (1st digit) - can't go back (with 'SYMBOL
              SHIFT'). 'ENTER' quits input mode and new sector number is used to
              read new ISO image (when you get 'No ISO image found' message, try
              searching).
E = eject   - ejects the medium (ATAPI only)
Enter       - starts file browser

File browser controls:
up          - move cursor to previous file
down        - move cursor to next file
left        - skip to begin of the page, if cursor is already on the beginning
              skip to previous page
right       - skip to end of the page, if cursor is already on the and, skip to
              next page
Enter       - action = view of the picture (waits for any key), snapshot run,
              walk through directories or TAP files, "load cursor" set (depends
              on circumstances)
Space       - file browser exit


When you working with TAP files, cursor goes green (everything is ok), red
(broken TAP file) or yellow (TAP file is ok, but contains too many files and
DEMFIR can't index it => you can't use these unindexed files).

When LOADing from TAP file and "load cursor" come to file end, TAP file is
automatically "rewinded" to start. Position of "load cursor" can be anytime
determined/changed by file browser.
